- **is_paid**: Whether the course is paid or free.
- **num_subscribers**: Number of subscribers enrolled in the course.
- **price**: Price of the course.
- **published_timestamp**: Date when the course was published.
- **level**: Difficulty level of the course (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

## Key Questions and Insights

The project answers several key questions about the Udemy courses dataset, including:

Q. 1) What are all different subjects for which Udemy is offering courses ?
Q. 2) Which subject has the maximum number of courses.
Q. 3) Show all the courses which are Free of Cost.
Q. 4) Show all the courses which are Paid.
Q. 5) Which are Top Selling Courses ?
Q. 6) Which are Least Selling Courses ?
Q. 7) Show all courses of Graphic Design where the price is below 100 ?
Q. 8) List out all the courses that are related to 'Python'.
Q. 9) What are courses that were published in the year 2015 ?
Q. 10) What is the Max. Number of Subscribers for Each Level of courses ?


### Key Insights:

1. **Most Popular Subject**:
   - Web Development is the leading subject with the highest number of courses offered. This indicates a strong demand for web development skills.

2. **Free Courses**:
   - A significant portion of the Udemy courses are available for free, providing learners with accessible options for learning without financial commitment.

3. **Top-Selling Courses**:
   - Courses with the highest number of subscribers indicate high demand and relevance in specific topics. These courses can be used as benchmarks for course creation.

4. **Pricing Strategy for Graphic Design**:
   - Since there are no graphic design courses priced below $100, it could be an opportunity for course creators to explore affordable pricing models in this subject.

5. **Python Courses**:
   - There is a strong interest in Python courses. If you are a course creator, targeting the Python niche could be a lucrative opportunity.

### Recommendations:

- **Course Creation Strategy**: Focus on creating courses in high-demand subjects such as Web Development, or explore subtopics within Python to cater to growing demand.
- **Pricing Adjustments**: Consider introducing affordable pricing options for Graphic Design courses to attract more learners.
- **Marketing**: Courses with high subscriber counts can be leveraged for targeted marketing campaigns, emphasizing their popularity and success.
